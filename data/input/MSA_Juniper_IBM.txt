MASTER SERVICES AGREEMENT
This Master Services Agreement is between Juniper Networks, Inc., a Delaware corporation with a principal place of business at 1133 Innovation Way, Sunnyvale, California 94089 (Customer), and International Business Machines Corporation, a New York corporation with a principal place of business at One New Orchard Road, Armonk, New York 10504 (Provider).
Provider is in the business of providing outsourcing, professional and other related services to customers. Customer Group desires to obtain certain outsourcing, professional and other related services from Provider, and Provider desires to provide such services to Customer Group, such Services as described in the Statements of Work to be entered into from time to time by Customer Group and Provider pursuant to the terms and conditions of this MSA. Customer and Provider desire to set forth in this MSA the general terms and conditions pursuant to which Provider will provide such services to Customer and all other members of Customer Group under the applicable Statements of Work.
Therefore, Customer and Provider (each a Party and together the Parties) agree as follows:
ARTICLE 1.DEFINITIONS AND INTERPRETATION.
1.1Definitions. Capitalized terms used in the Agreement have the meanings set forth in Schedule1 (Definitions) or Schedule 3 (Cross-Functional Terms) unless otherwise defined in the context of the provision.
1.2Interpretation. In the Agreement, unless otherwise specified, (A) headings are for ease of reference only and will not be taken into account in construing or interpreting the Agreement; (B) references to any recital, Section, Exhibit, Schedule, or paragraph are to those contained in the Agreement; (C) all Exhibits and Schedules to the Agreement are an integral part of the Agreement and are incorporated in the Agreement by such reference; (D) the use of the term including, means including without limitation, include without limitation or includes without limitation. Similarly, the term for example and the abbreviation e.g. mean as one example and without limitation of other examples; (E) the singular includes the plural and vice versa and any gender includes either gender; (F) all references to time refer to the local prevailing time in Sunnyvale, California; (G) all references to dollars or $ will mean United States Dollars, unless otherwise indicated; (H) reference to any statute, law, regulation, rule, delegated legislation, or order is to any statute, law, regulation, rule, delegated legislation, or order as amended, modified, or replaced from time to time and to any statute, law, regulation, rule, delegated legislation, or order replacing or made under any of them; (I) the expression this Section or this section will, unless followed by reference to a specific provision, be deemed to refer to the whole clause (not merely the sub-clause, paragraph, or other provision) in which the expression occurs; and (J) in writing includes any communication made by letter, facsimile, or email, in accordance with Section 25.2 (Notices), below.
ARTICLE 2.TERM.
2.1Initial Term. The term of this MSA commences on December 31, 2018 (the Effective Date) and will continue until the termination or expiration of the last remaining Statement of Work under this MSA unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with its terms. Each Statement of Work executed between the Parties will specify its effective date and expiration date, unless earlier terminated in accordance with the terms of this MSA or extended in accordance with Section2.2 (SOW Term Extensions). If the expiration date for a specified Statement of Work occurs after the expiration or termination of this MSA, then this MSA will remain effective solely for the provision of Services under such Statement of Work, until the expiration or termination of such Statement of Work.
2.2SOW Term Extensions. Customer may extend each Statement of Work for up to one (1) extension period or such other extension periods as agreed upon in an applicable Statement of Work (each, a SOW Term Extension), each of up to twelve (12) months, on the same terms and conditions (including no increase in Fees) by giving Provider notice of such extension and of the length thereof at least ninety(90)days before the end of the term of such Statement of Work or any SOW Term Extension under this Section 2.2 (SOW Term Extensions).
ARTICLE 3.SERVICES.
3.1Statements of Work.
(A)Provider will provide the Services to, and perform the Services for, Customer Group, for use by Customer Group and its Authorized Users in accordance with this MSA and one or more Statements of Work. Providers timely performance of the Services under an applicable Statement of Work is of the utmost importance to Customer. Providers failure to meet applicable Service Levels or the milestones or other deadlines set forth in an applicable Statement of Work according to the terms of the Agreement or the applicable Statement of Work will be a breach of Providers obligations under the Agreement.
(B)If Customer and/or Customer Group desires Provider to perform Services pursuant to this MSA, and Provider agrees to perform such Services, Customer and/or Customer Group and Provider will enter into one or more Statements of Work for such Services, each substantially in the form included in Schedule2 (Form of Statement of Work) (each, a Statement of Work or SOW).
(C)In the event that a particular Statement of Work contemplates the delivery of Services to entities in geographies outside the United States, the Parties will enter into, or cause each of their respective Affiliates to enter into, one or more local country agreements for the purpose of memorializing the implementation of this MSA and the applicable Statement of Work (each, a Local Services Agreement) at the country level. All Services will be provided by Provider or the applicable Affiliate of Provider pursuant to this MSA or an executed Local Services Agreement. Unless and to the extent an individual Local Services Agreement expressly provides otherwise, each Local Services Agreement will incorporate by reference the terms and conditions of this MSA and will not be construed as altering or superseding the rights and obligations of the Parties under this MSA. The term of each Local Services Agreement will commence on the Effective Date of the applicable Local Services Agreement and will continue until the last day of the term of the applicable SOWs, unless earlier terminated or extended in accordance with the terms of this MSA or such Local Services Agreement.
(D)From time to time during the Term, Customer and/or Customer Group may wish to obtain Services that are not then covered by an existing Statement of Work and that are materially different from or materially in addition to the Services (New Services). For the avoidance of doubt, additional volumes of Services for which there is a charging mechanism specified in the applicable SOW are not considered New Services. In the case of New Services, Customer has no obligation to provide Provider with a first right of refusal to provide New Services to Customer Group. Customer may, in its sole discretion, elect to have Provider bid to provide New Services to Customer Group. If Customer so elects, Customer will provide Provider with a general description of the New Services to be provided, the business requirements, or the desired outcome. Provider will promptly, and at no charge to Customer, prepare a proposal to Customer setting forth the Statement of Work terms and conditions on which it would provide such New Services and will deliver to Customer a proposed Statement of Work in the form set forth in Schedule2


Confidential

MA-IB-00136-2018


Confidential Treatment Requested by Juniper Networks, Inc.

(Form of Statement of Work) or a proposed amendment to the applicable Statement of Work. The proposed Fees for New Services will consider the resources and expenses of Provider for Services that would no longer be required if Provider performed New Services. Customer will review Providers proposal and may request Changes. If Customer in its sole discretion decides to proceed with Provider providing the New Services, the Parties will negotiate in good faith and consistent with any existing Statement of Work regarding any such requested Changes and work to promptly finalize the Statement of Work for the New Services. Customer will not be obligated to pay for any New Services prior to the finalization of a Statement of Work unless expressly stated in the Statement of Work.
(E)In addition to the services, functions, responsibilities, and tasks expressly described in the scope of services or other detailed description of the Services under a Statement of Work, the following are deemed to be included in the Services as if expressly described in the Agreement:
(1)All services, functions, responsibilities, and tasks that are an inherent part of, or a necessary sub-part included within, or that are reasonably required for or incidental to the proper and complete performance and provision of the expressly described Services;
(2)communication and coordination of efforts by and among Provider Staff as required to perform such services, functions, responsibilities, and tasks pursuant to a Statement of Work;
(3)in the case of a Statement of Work involving the transfer of Affected Employees, the services, functions, responsibilities, and tasks that were performed by the Affected Employees on a consistent or routine basis during the twelve(12) months preceding the SOW Effective Date;
(4)all services, functions, tasks or responsibilities necessary for Provider to comply with Customer Policies, as described in Section 3.16 (Customer Policies) below; and
(5)all services, functions, tasks or responsibilities necessary for Provider to comply with the cross-functional service terms, as described in Schedule3 (Cross-Functional Service Terms.
(F)Provider will provide the Services to Customer Group designated by Customer and provide such Services at least at the industry standards practiced generally by top tier well managed service providers providing similar services in similar circumstances, but in no case less than the standard performed by Affected Employees during the twelve(12)months preceding the applicable SOW Effective Date.
(G)Each Statement of Work must be signed by an Authorized Representative of each Party. Provider acknowledges and agrees that no Statement of Work will be effective unless and until signed by Authorized Representatives of both Parties. All Statements of Work incorporate by reference and are subject to, the terms and conditions of this MSA. Once executed by both Parties, the new Statement of Work will be effective as of the effective date specified in the Statement of Work and become a part of and be a Schedule to this MSA, and the Services thereunder will form part of the Services governed by the Agreement. The Statements of Work will be serially numbered (i.e., the first being Statement of Work No.1, the second being Statement of Work No.2, the third being Statement of Work No.3, etc.) and include a brief substantive description in the title.
(H)This MSA together with each Statement of Work is to be interpreted as a single agreement so that all provisions are given as full effect as possible. In the event of a conflict between the terms of this MSA and a Statement of Work, this MSA will control, except to the extent the Parties expressly agree in such Statement of Work that the Statement of Work will control with respect to the specific provision of the MSA to be overridden. The order of precedence is as follows (items with a lower number having priority over, and controlling in the event of a conflict with, items having a higher number): (1)this MSA, (2)any Schedules or other attachments incorporated in this MSA other than Statements of Work, and (3)the Statements of Work including the Exhibits and other attachments thereto (but only with respect to Services to be performed under such Statement of Work).
3.2Non-Exclusivity of Services. Customer retains the right to perform itself or retain Customer Agents and/or other third parties to perform any or a portion of the Services subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Section 19.1 (Termination for Convenience). In the case of Customers reduction of any Services under this Section3.2 (Non-Exclusivity of Services), the Fees for the remaining Services will be as set forth in a Statement of Work; or if not addressed in the Statement of Work, the Fees will be equitably adjusted to reflect those Services that are no longer required and in the case of a Partial Termination the provisions of Section 19.1 (Termination for Convenience) will apply.
3.3No Minimum Commitment. As of the Effective Date, Customer intends to use Provider to meet certain of its outsourcing needs during the Term. However, Customer does not make any minimum Fee or volume commitment under the Agreement unless otherwise provided in the Fees Exhibit to a Statement of Work. Nothing in the Agreement will be interpreted as a requirements contract or a take-or-pay contract. Furthermore, Provider does not receive any exclusive rights under the Agreement and nothing in the Agreement will be construed as requiring Customer or Customer Group to purchase services solely from Provider. Any and all Fees must be agreed to in writing by Customer and Provider in advance.
3.4Projects. From time to time during the Term, Customer may engage Provider to perform a Project in accordance with the project engagement procedure set forth in Schedule5 (Governance). Provider will comply with Schedule5 (Governance) and perform each Project, complete all Project Milestones, and provide all Deliverables in accordance with the Project Documents.
3.5Changes to Customer Group. If a change to all or part of Customers business structure, by merger, acquisition, divestiture, or reorganization (Restructuring) results in an entity that was not previously an Affiliate of Customer becoming part of Customer Group (Acquired Entity), then Customer may require Provider to provide the Services to the Acquired Entity under the Agreement. If a Restructuring results in a business that was previously Controlled by Customer or one of its Affiliates no longer being Controlled by Customer or one of its Affiliates (Divested

Entities and, together with Acquired Entities, New Entities), then Customer may require Provider to provide the Services to the Divested Entity under the terms of the Agreement for a period of up to [***]. If Customer notifies Provider that it is considering or intends to engage in a Restructuring, Provider will, at no additional cost to Customer, provide reasonable assistance, information, and advice to assist Customer in evaluating the time and expense and any associated risks of providing Services to an Acquired Entity or continuing or terminating Services to a Divested Entity.
3.6Governmental Approvals and Consents. At its own expense, Provider will (A)obtain and maintain all Governmental Approvals required for Provider and all Provider Agents to provide the Services; (B)obtain, maintain, and comply with all of the Provider Consents; and (C)comply with the Customer Consents. With Provider providing assistance as requested by Customer, Customer will obtain, maintain and comply with the Customer Consents. As requested by the other Party, each Party will cooperate with the other Party in the other Partys obtainment of the Governmental Approvals and the Consents that such other Party is required to obtain pursuant to this Section3.6 (Governmental Approvals and Consents). If Customer is unable to satisfy its obligation to obtain a Customer Consent, the Parties will discuss and agree upon commercially reasonable alternative approaches as are necessary and sufficient to provide the Services without such Customer Consent, and such alternative approaches will be documented pursuant to the Change Control Procedures.
3.7Technology and Process Evolution. In providing the Services to Customer and/or Customer Group, Provider will, at no additional cost to Customer and/or Customer Group, (A)use commercially reasonable efforts to continually improve its technology and processes to allow Customer and/or Customer Group to take advantage of technological and process advances related to the Services, (B)regularly provide for Customers evaluation any technology developments that could reasonably be expected to have a positive impact on the Services that Provider uses or intends to use for any of its other clients for similar services, and (C)leverage its leading available technology and processes as appropriate for a given service when providing Services of that type for Customer and/or Customer Group as described in the applicable Statement of Work.
3.8Knowledge Sharing.
(A)At least once every Contract Year or upon request after at least thirty(30) days notice from Customer, Provider will meet with representatives of Customer to in a reasonable level of detail (1)explain how the Services are provided, (2)explain how the Provider Systems work and should be operated, and (3)provide such training and Documentation as Customer may require for Customer to (a)provide services that interact with or interface with the Services, (b)understand and operate the Provider Systems, and (c)understand and perform the Services after the expiration or termination of the Agreement.
(B)In addition to the Process Interface Manual, upon Customers request from time to time, Provider will deliver to Customer a full description of the processes, tools, and environmental configuration related to the Services.
3.9Reports. Provider will provide to Customer, in a form acceptable to Customer, the reports and/or explanations and/or Documentation and/or materials described in the Agreement and in all Statements of Work. Providers costs in collecting and analyzing data and in preparing such reports are included in the Fees and are not subject to any additional charges, fees, or reimbursements. At any time during the Term, Customer may require reasonable additional ad-hoc reports. Such additional reasonable ad-hoc reports will be provided by Provider at no additional cost. Any requests for ad-hoc reports beyond such reasonable ad-hoc reports may be subject to the Change Control Procedures.

3.10Customer Systems. In providing the Services, Provider will ensure that it does not, without the prior written consent of an Authorized Representative of Customer or acting in accordance with a signed Statement of Work in which Provider expressly sets forth the anticipated adverse effect or alteration, adversely affect or alter (A)the operation, functionality, security, or technical environment of the Customer Systems or (B)the processes used by Customer, Customer Group, or Customer Agents in connection with their businesses (the Retained Processes). Provider will be proactive in keeping itself informed about Customer Systems and Retained Processes as necessary to provide the Services. At Customers request, Provider will coordinate with Customer to evaluate the impact of any alterations to Customer Systems and Retained Processes to the extent such alterations may impact the Services. Customer may furnish Provider Staff with access to Customer Systems, as expressly set forth in the applicable SOW when and to the limited extent necessary for the performance of Services under this Agreement. Provider will limit all access to Customer Systems, whether provided at a Service Location or through remote access, to such Provider Staff approved in advance in writing by an Authorized Representative of Customer and to such access as is reasonably necessary in connection with the performance of Services, only for the minimum duration necessary to perform the relevant Services, and as otherwise may be limited by the terms of agreements with third parties (to the extent any relevant requirements have been disclosed in advance by Customer to Provider). Provider will ensure that no Provider Staff will have standing access to Customer Systems (i.e., continuing access whether or not the individual is actively engaged in the performance of Services). Customer will make such Customer Systems available on an AS IS, WHERE IS, AS AVAILABLE basis, with no warranties whatsoever. Customer may terminate any and all such access at any time and upon such termination, such Provider Staff will immediately cease all access and use of such Customer Systems and any Non-Provider Failure resulting from such termination of access will be treated in accordance with Section 3.20 (Excuse from Performance). Provider will comply with, and will ensure Provider Staff comply with, all agreements with third parties and all Customer Policies prohibiting or restricting remote access to Customer Systems (to the extent any relevant requirements and Customer Policies have been disclosed in advance by Customer to Provider).
3.11Satisfaction Surveys. Provider and Customer will conduct satisfaction surveys as set forth in the Statements of Work.
3.12Responsibility for Resources. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this MSA or the applicable Statement of Work, Provider will be responsible for providing the Service Locations, personnel, Systems, software, technical knowledge, expertise, and other resources necessary to provide the Services.
3.13Work Reprioritization. Customer may identify new activities to be performed by Provider Staff then assigned on a dedicated basis to providing the Services (including work activities that would otherwise be treated as a Project) or reprioritize or reset the schedule for existing work activities to be performed by such Provider Staff, so long as such activities are similar to the types of activities that Provider Staff is trained to perform. Unless otherwise agreed in writing, Customer will incur no additional charges for the performance of such work activities by Provider Staff to the extent such work activities can be performed by the dedicated Provider Staff then assigned to Customer. Provider will use commercially reasonable efforts to perform such work activities without impacting the established schedule for other tasks or the performance of the Services in accordance with the Service Levels. If after using such efforts it is not possible to avoid such an impact, Provider will notify Customer of the anticipated impact and obtain Customers consent prior to proceeding with such work activities. In its sole discretion, Customer may forego or delay such work activities or temporarily adjust the work to be performed by Provider, the schedules associated with the work, or the Service Levels to permit the performance by Provider of such work activities at no additional cost or charge to Customer. Any Non-Provider Failure resulting from such re-prioritized work will be treated in accordance with Section 3.20 (Excuse from Performance)

3.14Cooperation with Third Parties. The performance of Services may involve work with the former third-party suppliers of the Services (Former Providers) and other third-party suppliers, consultants, advisors, suppliers, contractors, and agents of Customer. If reasonably requested by Customer, Provider will work diligently with any and all such third parties as specified by Customer in writing for the purposes of the fulfillment of the Services and at no additional charge. Without limiting the foregoing, Provider will provide such cooperative assistance and access to Provider Systems as reasonably requested by Customer Group, including providing: (i) the necessary information related to the Services that Customer Group requests to enable Customer Group to draft a request for proposal(s) relating to the Services and to provide existing information to support due diligence for recipients of such request for proposal; (ii) access to Service Locations used by Provider to provide the Services as necessary for Customer Group or third-party suppliers to survey the current environment being used to deliver the Service(s) (other than a Shared Service Delivery Environment); (iii)assistance and support services to Customer Group or third-party suppliers to the extent related to the Services; (iv) making the Provider Systems available to Customer, Customer Agents, and/or the third-party supplier in accordance with and to the extent required by Article 20 (Termination Assistance) and Schedule 4 (Termination Assistance); (v) such information regarding the operating environment, Provider System constraints and other operating parameters related to the Services as a person with reasonable commercial skills and expertise would find reasonably necessary for the Customer Group or third-party suppliers to perform the Services; and (vi) assisting Customer in obtaining all required Customer Consents. For the avoidance of doubt, under no circumstances are any such providers, consultants, advisors, suppliers, or contractors of Customer authorized to bind Customer in any way or enter into any commitments on behalf of Customer. Provider will treat Confidential Information received from Former Providers, such third-party suppliers, consultants, advisors, suppliers, and contractors in connection with the provision of Services as Customers Confidential Information subject to the terms of the Agreement. If the foregoing obligations require any of Providers Confidential Information to be disclosed to a third party, such third party must execute a reasonable non-disclosure agreement before receiving such information. Customer will ensure that the terms of such non-disclosure agreement are at least as protective of Providers Confidential Information as the terms of the Agreement. In connection with such cooperation and access, Customer, Customer Agents and other third parties will comply with Providers reasonable security and confidentiality requirements provided in advance in writing to Customer, and will, to the extent performing work on Provider Systems, comply with Providers reasonable standards, methodologies, and procedures provided in advance in writing to Customer.

Provider acknowledges that Customer may update, amend, and modify the Customer Policies and issue new Customer Policies from time to time. If changes to any such Customer Policies or any new Customer Policies are first disclosed to Provider, or revised, after the Effective Date, to the extent that Providers compliance with the newly disclosed or revised policies and procedures would materially increase or decrease: (A) Providers resource requirements; and/or (B) level of effort or ability to perform the affected Services, either Party may request the Parties to enter the Change Control Procedures specified on Schedule 6 (Change Control Procedures) to expeditiously negotiate in good faith a change order and an equitable allocation of increased or decreased costs, if any. For the avoidance of doubt, Provider will comply with such new, updated, amended, or modified Customer Policies and will cause its Provider Agents to comply with all such Customer Policies. Customer will notify Provider of any such updates, amendments or modifications to Customer Policies in writing and Provider will be responsible for complying with such changes thereafter.

If Provider Staff are responsible for such incidents, appropriate disciplinary action will be taken in accordance with the appropriate Provider Staff policies. Such disciplinary action may include Provider removing such Provider Staff from providing Services to Customer.
3.18Process Interface Manual. As Provider transitions and migrates Services in accordance with each applicable Transition Plan, Provider will as part of Transition, with Customers input and cooperation, develop and update as-needed at all times during the applicable SOW term, a detailed, Customer-specific Process Interface Manual for each of the Services in a mutually agreed form and scope that minimally includes the content specified on Schedule 7 (Program Management and Process Interface Manual).

(A)Provider acknowledges and agrees that it has performed reasonable due diligence required to perform its obligations under the Agreement. Provider will not be entitled to adjust the Fees or be relieved of any obligations under the Agreement, including performing the Services and satisfying the Service Levels, as a result of: (A) its failure to request any information or documents from Customer; (B) its failure to review any information or documents provided by or on behalf of Customer, including information or documents provided by or on behalf of Customer under the Statements of Work; or (C) its failure to verify any assumptions that would otherwise impact the Services or Fees.

(B)During the period starting after the Effective Date and ending on [***] (the Joint Verification Period), Customer and Provider may inventory and validate any information that is reflected in or omitted from this Agreement based on information provided by Customer prior to the Effective Date, related to the following categories: 1) resource unit baselines; 2) third-party contracts, leases, licenses that are in scope; 3) Customer Systems; and 3) Affected Employees and their responsibilities (Verifiable Information).
(1)Customer and Provider will each appoint a business lead responsible for leading and coordinating the joint verification process for Customer and Provider, respectively (Joint Verification Leads).

At the initial meeting, Providers Joint Verification Lead will present a list of any Verifiable Information that Provider would like to verify.
(2)If, as a result of this joint verification process, Customer or Provider discovers inaccuracies or omissions in Verifiable Information, Customer and Provider will negotiate in good faith to amend this Agreement to provide for an equitable adjustment to the Fees, baselines, Service Levels and other terms of this Agreement affected by such inaccuracies or omissions. If either Party disputes the inaccuracy or the equitable adjustment, either Party may submit the matter to the escalation process in Schedule 5 (Governance).
3.20Excuse from Performance. Provider will be excused from failures to perform Services only if and to the extent (A) caused by (i) the act or omission of Customer, a member of Customer Group or a third party engaged by or managed by Customer (except if and to the extent caused by Provider); (ii) any Equipment, Customer Software, or other technology refresh or maintenance for which Customer or a member of Customer Group is responsible to the extent such responsibility is identified in the Statement of Work; (iii) Provider acting, or refraining from acting, in accordance with the written decision or direction of the Customer Relationship Manager; provided that Provider has described the potential adverse consequences to the Customer Relationship Manager in writing; or (v) Customer or Customer Groups failure to perform one or more Customer Operational Responsibilities or of Customers responsibilities expressly identified in this Agreement or the applicable SOW, provided such Customer responsibilities are reasonably required under the circumstances and are not hindered, impaired, delayed, or otherwise impacted by or dependent on Provider, Provider Agents, or Provider Staff (a Non-Provider Failure); (B) such Non-Provider Failure directly and materially causes Providers failure to perform the applicable Services (an Excused Performance Failure); and (C) Provider, as soon as reasonably possible under the circumstances, (1) notifies Customer of the Non-Provider Failure and Customer fails to remedy the failure; (2) uses commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate the adverse consequences of the Non-Provider Failure; and (3) timely resumes performing the affected Services upon resolution of the Non-Provider Failure. Customer will not be in breach of the Agreement, and Provider will not have the right to terminate this MSA, the applicable SOW, or the Services (in each case, in whole or in part), to claim damages, or to seek other remedies (except for excuse from performance under this section) due to the there being a Non-Provider Failure that causes an Excused Performance Failure (except for Customers obligations hereunder related to payment and withholding of disputed Fees). Each member of Provider Staff is expected to immediately escalate an issue if such Provider Staff members performance is impacted by a Non-Provider Failure. Notwithstanding any Non-Provider Failure, Provider will use proactive, good faith efforts at all times to maximize the possibility that the Services will nonetheless be performed in a timely manner.

Each member of Provider Staff will be a party to a written agreement or certification process with Provider, sufficient to require, that (A)requires the person to abide by (1) Customer Policies, (2)Schedule 9 (Information and System Security Requirements), and (3)other Statements of Work in performing the Services, (B)requires the person to comply with the confidentiality provisions of the Agreement. In addition, each member of Provider Staff will be a party to a written agreement with Provider that contains such provisions for the assignment of Intellectual Property Rights as are necessary for Customer to receive ownership of Assigned Rights under the assignment set forth in Article 16 (Intellectual Property Rights).

9.3Provider Staff Removal. If Customer determines that a member of Provider Staff should be removed from Customers account, Provider will have a reasonable opportunity to investigate the situation and discuss it with Customer, and if the situation is not resolved to Customers satisfaction promptly, Provider will immediately remove such individual upon Providers receipt of notice from Customer.
9.4Background Check and Work Eligibility. At its expense and in compliance with applicable Law, Provider is responsible for conducting a background check and substance abuse screening of each member of Provider Staff. Provider will conduct background checks and substance abuse screenings in accordance with the requirements detailed in Schedule 10 (Background Checks) in addition to any and all requirements provided in the human resource related attachments to the Statement of Work (the Human Resource Exhibits of such Statement of Work). Without limiting the requirements specified in the Human Resource Exhibits, Provider Staff background checks and substance abuse screenings will include investigation of such matters as reasonably required by applicable Law or by Customer, subject to the limitations of applicable Law. Furthermore, Provider must complete background checks and substance abuse screenings for each member of Provider Staff prior to or within 15 days of such member initial providing Services to Customer. Provider will maintain Documentation evidencing that background investigations and substance abuse screenings have been completed on all Provider Staff and will grant Customer access to such Documentation upon request.
Provider will not assign individuals to Provider Staff who, based on the results of their background check or substance abuse screening, are likely to present a threat to the safety or security of people or assets on Customers premises or at Service Locations. For those Provider Staff needing a visa to enter and/or remain in the country in which Services are rendered, or otherwise needing immigration status in any country in which Services are rendered in order to carry out activities in connection with the Agreement, Provider and Provider Staff will (A) pay for and be solely responsible for obtaining and maintaining such visas and (B) take all steps necessary to obtain and maintain appropriate immigration classifications or status for such personnel. Provider will, and will cause its Provider Staff, to comply fully with the terms and conditions of any immigration classification or status.
9.5Restricted Parties Compliance. All Provider Agents and Provider Staff performing the Services in the United States or supporting Provider activities under the Agreement, regardless of their location, will be validated by Provider to not be on any list publicly published and maintained by the U.S. government of Persons or entities with whom any U.S. Person or entity is prohibited from conducting business (Restricted Parties Lists).
Provider is responsible for ensuring that it remains informed of the Restricted Parties Lists and that at the time of hire no Provider Agents or Provider Staff are on any of these lists. Provider is also responsible for reviewing updates to the Restricted Parties Lists. In the event that Provider or Customer becomes aware of any Provider Agents or Provider Staff being included on any Restricted Parties List, Provider will promptly remove such Provider Agents or Provider Staff from any involvement in or in support of the Services and will report to Customer that it has done so.
9.6Provider Agents.
(A)Except as provided in (B) below, Provider may not delegate or subcontract any of the Services or any of Providers obligations under the Agreement, in whole or in part, without obtaining Customers prior written consent. To obtain Customers approval of a Provider Agent, Provider must notify Customer of the proposed Provider

Agent, and the scope of the Services proposed to be subcontracted. In any event, Provider must require its Provider Agents to meet, exceed, and/or comply with any applicable terms of the Agreement.
(B)Provider may, in the ordinary course of business and without Customers prior written consent, enter into subcontracts (i) with the Provider Affiliates listed on Schedule 11 (Provider Affiliates); (ii) with subcontractors that it uses in a Shared Service Delivery Environment where such services or products do not represent material components of the Services and do not involve any direct contact with Customer Personnel or access to or other Processing of Confidential Information, including any Personally Identifiable Information, of any member of Customer Group; or (iii) for third-party services or products that represent non-material tasks that do not involve any direct contact with Customer Personnel or access to or other Processing of Confidential Information, including any Personally Identifiable Information, of any member of Customer Group.
(C)No subcontracting will release Provider from its responsibility for its obligations under the Agreement. Provider is responsible for the work and activities of each of Provider Agents and members of Provider Staff employed by Provider Agents. Provider will be liable for any breach of, or act or omission under, this Agreement by any Provider Agent or member of Provider Staff employed by a Provider Agent. Provider is responsible for all payments to Provider Agents. Provider will promptly pay for all services, materials, equipment and labor used by Provider in providing the Services, and Provider will promptly cause any Provider Agent to remove all claims against Customer or lien on Customer Resources.
(D)Customer may require Provider to remove from providing Services to Customer or to replace any Provider Agent who is deemed unacceptable by Customer for performance or any other reasonable reason, including potential harm to reputation or violation of Law. Except in the case of a violation of Law or unauthorized Processing of Personally Identifiable Information, Provider will have a reasonable opportunity to investigate Customers concerns but no more than [***] Business Days after the Customer request, correct the Provider Agents deficient performance and provide Customer with a written action plan to assure that such deficient performance will not recur. If Customer is not reasonably satisfied with Providers efforts, Provider will remove and replace such Provider Agent as soon as possible.
9.7Services to Customer Competitors. No dedicated Provider Staff or Key Personnel will provide services to any Customer Competitor at a time when they have access to Customers Confidential Information and for one(1)month before or one (1) year after they have such access. Provider will take such steps that are reasonable and necessary to prevent Customers Confidential Information from being disclosed to any Provider Staff performing services on behalf of any Customer Competitor.
9.8Qualifications and Training of Provider Staff. Provider will assign a clearly adequate number of Provider Staff to perform the Services and will account for turnover (voluntary and involuntary). Provider Staff will be properly educated, trained, and fully qualified for the Services they are to perform. Provider will not charge Customer for the costs of training such Provider Staff, including for the time necessary for such Provider Staff to become familiar with providing Services to Customer or with Customer or with Customers business. This training will include at least any required continued education and ongoing training related to data protection, risk control, regulatory requirements, and other relevant education.

9.9Personnel Turnover Rate. Provider will take steps to keep the turnover (voluntary and involuntary) rate of Provider Staff at a level that (A)ensures continued performance of the Services in compliance with the Agreement and (B)is comparable to or better than the industry average for well-managed service providers in the applicable country performing services similar to the Services. Provider will provide to Customer a semi-annual turnover (voluntary and involuntary) report of Provider Staff, and the Parties will work together to reduce the turnover (voluntary and involuntary) rate. Provider will ensure that all replacement personnel receive sufficient information and training, without additional charge to Customer, to assure continuity of Services without adverse impact. For avoidance of doubt, the turnover (voluntary and involuntary) rate of Provider Staff is not an acceptable justification for Provider not meeting or exceeding a Service Level. Provider is responsible for managing turnover (voluntary and involuntary) to meet or exceed established Service Levels.

ARTICLE 10.CONTINUED PROVISION OF SERVICES.

10.1Disaster Recovery Plan. Provider will maintain adequate disaster recovery and business continuity plans in respect of each Service Location from which the Services are provided or supported that, at a minimum, meet the requirements of Schedule12 (Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Requirements) (each, a Provider DR Plan). Provider will update and test the Provider DR Plans at least annually (or such other frequency specified in Schedule 12) and certify in writing the results of such testing to Customer. Provider also will comply with such other requirements specified in Schedule12 (Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Requirements). Upon a disaster, Provider will promptly undertake all applicable actions and precautions under the Provider DR Plan or Customer DR Plan (as defined in Schedule12 (Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Requirements)), as applicable, and diligently pursue them as necessary to avoid or, if unavoidable, minimize any interruption of Services, and will provide for the recovery and reconstitution of the affected System to a known state after a disruption, compromise, or failure within defined time periods consistent with recovery time and recovery point objectives. If the Services are not reinstated within the defined recovery time periods set out in Schedule 12 (Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Requirements), Provider will work to reinstate Services within a reasonable time as agreed upon with Customer.
10.2Force Majeure. If and to the extent that a Partys performance is prevented or delayed by fire, flood, riot, war, pandemic, acts of God, or other events beyond such Partys reasonable control (other than failure to perform by, or acts or omissions of, Provider Agents in connection with their responsibilities under the Agreement) and without the fault or negligence of the Party affected (a Force Majeure Event), then the affected performance will be excused for so long as (A)the Force Majeure Event continues to prevent or delay performance and (B)the Party continues efforts to recommence performance to the extent possible without delay or disruption to Services, including through the use of alternate sources and workaround plans. The affected Party will promptly notify the other Party in writing, describing the Force Majeure Event in reasonable detail. Force Majeure Events do not excuse any disaster recovery and business continuity obligations under Section10.1 (Disaster Recovery Plan). Other than a Force Majeure Event subject to the parameters of this Section10.2 (Force Majeure), neither Party will assert any excuse or defense to a breach of contract claim under the doctrine of impossibility, impracticability or frustration of purpose, or other similar legal argument. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Force Majeure Event expressly excludes: (A) any event that Provider reasonably could have prevented by any testing either required to be performed pursuant to the Services or


Confidential

necessary to provide the Services; (B) any Provider Staff strike, walkout or other labor shortage; (C) any non-performance of a Provider Agent, regardless of cause (unless due to a Force Majeure Event); in the case of a Cyber Attack that would otherwise be deemed a Force Majeure Event, any event that could have been prevented through Providers compliance with the Agreement or Customer Policies; and/or (D) any event which could have been prevented by reasonable precautions and can reasonably be circumvented by the non-performing Party through the use of alternate sources, work-around plans, or other means.
10.3Alternate Source. If any Force Majeure Event or disaster delays performance of Services necessary for the performance of functions Customer reasonably identifies as critical for more than [***] days, Customer may procure such Services from an alternate source, and Provider will reimburse Customer for reasonable amounts paid to the alternate source to the extent exceeding the Fees for such Services for up to a period of one hundred and eighty (180) days or until Provider is able to resume performance of the affected Services. If the Force Majeure Event or disaster delays performance of such critical Services for more than twenty(20) additional days, Customer may terminate this Agreement, the applicable Statement of Work, or the affected Services as of the date specified by Customer in a termination notice to Provider subject to payment of any Termination Charge Amounts set forth in the applicable Statement of Work.
10.4No Payment for Unperformed Services. Customer is not required to pay for those Services that are not performed because of excused performance in a Force Majeure Event or under Section 3.20 (Excuse from Performance).
10.5Allocation of Resources. Whenever a Force Majeure Event or a disaster causes Provider to allocate limited resources among Providers customers, Provider will not give other customers priority over Customer or redeploy or reassign any Key Personnel (except as permitted under the Agreement) to another Provider customer.
10.6Service Improvement Plan and Step-In. In the event (A) Provider is failing to deliver all or a material part of the Services in material conformance with the terms of the Agreement or (B) if Customer has a good faith basis for dissatisfaction with any portion of the Services that Customer reasonably identifies as critical, within fourteen (14) calendar days (or such shorter period as may be reasonably required in Customers notice to comply with a legal or regulatory requirement) after receipt of Customers written notice of such failure or dissatisfaction Provider will: (1) commence a root cause analysis as to the cause of such failure or dissatisfaction; (2) upon completion of a root cause analysis, develop a service improvement plan to address and remedy the failure and/or improve the level of satisfaction (SIP); (3)present such plan to Customer for its review, comment and approval; and (4) take action in accordance with the approved SIP. Customer and Provider will establish a schedule for completion of a root cause analysis and the preparation and approval of the SIP, which will be reasonable and consistent with the severity and materiality of the problem. Providers SIP developed hereunder will specify the specific measures to be taken by Provider and the dates by which each such action will be completed. Provider will perform its obligations under the SIP.
If Provider fails to implement such SIP and/or upon the occurrence of any Step-In Event, then Customer may assign Customer Personnel or third parties to step in and perform any failing elements of the Services until such time as Provider can reasonably demonstrate the ability to resume provision of such Services or

Provider will reasonably cooperate with any Customer, Customer Agents, Customer Group, or any other third party selected by Customer. In addition, upon the occurrence of any Step-In Event and at any time prior to the remediation, resolution, or cessation of the circumstances triggering the Step-In Event, Customer may exercise any of the following rights and take any of the following actions: (A)subject to Providers reasonable security and confidentiality requirements provided in advance in writing to Customer, enter and remain on any affected Service Location premises other than any Shared Service Delivery Environment; (B)take control of the Services (including the Provider Systems) other than Services and Provider Systems provided in a Shared Service Delivery Environment; and (C)give directions to and manage Provider Staff. If Customer exercises any of its rights under this Section10.6 (Service Improvement Plan and Step-In), Provider must provide all Documentation, materials, rights, and assistance reasonably required to enable Customer (or its nominee) to exercise the step-in rights under this Section10.6 (Service Improvement Plan and Step-In). During the Step-In Period, Customer will have no liability for or obligation to pay Provider for those Services and Provider will be relieved from its obligation to meet Service Levels for Services if and to the extent Customer has exercised its step-in rights under this Section and Provider is not performing such Services, for the Step-In Period. From and after completion of the Step-In Period, Provider will resume performing those Services in accordance with the Agreement (including Service Levels) and Customer will be obligated to pay for such Services in accordance with the Agreement. Customers exercise of its rights under this Section will not constitute a waiver by Customer of any termination rights or rights to pursue a claim for damages arising out of the failure that led to such rights being exercised.
ARTICLE 11.CUSTOMER OPERATIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES.
11.1Customer Resources. As needed for Provider to provide Transition Services and/or Transformation Services and/or the Services set forth in each Statement of Work, Customer will make available to Provider the Customer Resources in accordance with the following provisions:
(A)Provider will use the Customer Resources for the sole and exclusive purpose of providing the Transition Services and/or the Transformation Services under that Statement of Work to Customer and for the sole benefit of Customer and/or Customer Group;
(B)use by Provider of the Customer Resources does not constitute a leasehold interest in favor of Provider or any Provider Agents;
(C)Provider will use the Customer Resources in a reasonably efficient manner, reimbursing Customer for any unnecessary increased facility costs incurred by Customer;
(D)Provider will, and will ensure that Provider Agents, keep the Customer Resources in good order, not commit or permit waste or damage to Customer Resources, not use the Customer Resources for any unlawful purpose, and comply with Customers standard policies and procedures as in effect and updated from time to time, including procedures for the physical security of the Customer Resources;

(E)Provider will not make any improvements or changes involving structural, mechanical, or electrical alterations to any Customer Resources without Customers prior written approval; and
(F)when a Customer Resource is no longer required to provide Transition Services and/or Transformation Services and/or Services, Provider will return such resource to Customer in substantially the same condition as when Provider began using such resource, ordinary wear and tear excepted.
11.2Customer Operational Responsibilities. Customer will perform those operational responsibilities set forth in Section11.1 (Customer Resources) for each Transition Plan and/or Transformation Plan and for each Statement of Work with respect to the applicable Services (collectively, the Customer Operational Responsibilities).
ARTICLE 12.FEES AND PAYMENT.
12.1General. In consideration of the Services under each Statement of Work, Customer will pay Provider the Fees set forth in a schedule of payments and payment-related terms attached to that Statement of Work (Fee Exhibit). Except as expressly set forth in the Fee Exhibits, (A)no amounts are payable under the Agreement and (B)there will be no adjustments to the Fees unless agreed to in writing by an Authorized Representative of Customer. Provider will invoice the Fees under each Statement of Work as set forth in the Fee Exhibit, including such format as set forth in the applicable SOW and such detail as reasonably requested by Customer. Customer is not liable to pay any Fees not invoiced within [***] days after Provider was first entitled to invoice Customer for such Fees. Any and all undisputed Fees, the time for payment of which is not otherwise specified in the applicable Fee Exhibit, are due and payable [***] days after receipt of invoice from Provider that has been approved in accordance with Schedule 5 (Governance). Any unused credits against future payments (including Performance Credits and Deliverable Credits) owed to either Party by the other pursuant to a Statement of Work will be paid to the applicable Party within [***] days after the expiration or termination of the applicable Statement of Work. Schedule 17 (Extended Payment Plan) will apply with respect to invoicing and payment of Fees for Services subject to and in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.
12.2Expenses. All costs of providing the Services are included in the Fees and will not be reimbursed by Customer. When an SOW expressly permits reimbursement of Providers expenses, the type of expenses that Customer will reimburse must be expressly identified in such SOW and, to be reimbursed, such expenses must be (A) for pass-through expenses, at Providers actual cost incurred without mark-up of any kind; (B) reasonable and customary; (C) approved in writing in advance by Customer prior to Provider incurring such expense, unless otherwise provided in the SOW; and (D) any such charges will be accompanied by legible copies of receipts or other back-up documentation sufficient enough for Customer to validate any such charges.
12.3Disputed Fees and Right to Offset. Subject to the Disputed Payments Cap, Customer may withhold payment of any portion of an invoice that it disputes in good faith and will provide Provider with a written explanation in a form acceptable to Customer of the basis for any disputed amounts it has withheld. Customers failure to dispute or withhold a payment will not operate as a waiver of the right to dispute and recover such amount. Customer may deduct from the Fees owed by Customer to Provider any amount that should be reimbursed to Customer or is otherwise payable to Customer pursuant to this MSA or any Statement of Work, including but not limited to Deliverable Credits and Performance Credits.

Confidential Treatment Requested by Juniper Networks, Inc.

In the event of a payment dispute, the Parties will immediately investigate and attempt to resolve the dispute pursuant to Schedule 5 (Governance) hereof. Upon resolution of the dispute, Customer will promptly pay to Provider any disputed amounts due to Provider, and Provider will promptly pay Customer any disputed amounts due to Customer, based upon the agreement reached by the Parties during the dispute resolution process. In the event such withheld amounts would, in the aggregate, exceed the equivalent of [***] months of the Fees payable under the applicable Statement of Work (including under all related Local Services Agreements) (Disputed Payments Cap), Customer will pay to Provider, under protest and without waiver of any rights regarding the underlying dispute, all disputed amounts in excess of the Disputed Payment Cap as and when due.
12.4Transition Fees. Neither Customer nor any member of Customer Group will incur any charges, fees, or expenses payable to Provider or Provider Agents in connection with the Transition Services, other than those Fees specified in the applicable Fee Exhibit. In addition, to the extent Provider or Provider Agents knows of charges, fees, or expenses payable to third parties in connection with the Transition Services (other than those to be incurred by Customer in connection with its performance of tasks designated in the Transition Plan as Customers responsibility), such third-party charges, fees, and expenses will be generally described in the applicable Fee Exhibit. Within [***] calendar days after the SOW Effective Date, Provider will advise Customer in writing of those third-party vendors who, based on Providers prior knowledge from working with its other customers, typically charge their customers for required consents.
12.5Extraordinary Events. Any significant change in Customers business, such as merger, acquisitions, divestitures, general business downturn, or other business event that increases or decreases or is expected to increase or decrease the utilization of the Services under any Statement of Work by more than [***] percent ([***]%), and such change persists or is expected to continue for [***] or more months, will be deemed an Extraordinary Event. Upon such Extraordinary Event, Customer may elect to have the Fees equitably adjusted by providing notice to Provider (Extraordinary Event Notice). Such equitable adjustments will be based on Providers [***] and related [***] that either (A)can be eliminated by Provider in the event of an extraordinary reduction or (B)will be unavoidably incurred by Provider in the event of an extraordinary increase in such utilization. If the Parties cannot agree on an equitable adjustment to the Fees within [***] ([***]) days after Providers receipt of the Extraordinary Event Notice, Customer has the right to terminate the applicable Statement of Work, in whole or in part, by written notice to Provider effective as of the date specified in such notice, in accordance with the provisions of Section 19.1 (Termination for Convenience).
12.6Benchmarking Arrangement. Provider agrees to an arrangement with Customer to provide assurance to Customer that the Fees Customer pays for Services provide continuing excellent value. This arrangement includes the following terms:
(A)At any time after the first anniversary of the Effective Date but no more than once every 24 months during the Term, Customer may request the services of a benchmark service provider (Benchmarking Consultant) to evaluate the cost of the Services under any Statement of Work (Benchmarked Services) compared to other providers in the outsourcing industry (Benchmarking).

(B)The Benchmarking Consultant will be independent of the Parties, subject to a tripartite confidentiality agreement with protections no less protective to the confidentiality provisions of this Agreement, and will be qualified to do the Benchmarking. The Parties will identify a group of pre-approved Benchmarking Consultants. At the time that Customer requests Benchmarking, the Parties will work together to mutually agree upon a specific Benchmarking Consultant for the Benchmarking. If the Parties do not agree upon a specific Benchmarking Consultant within fifteen(15) Business Days of Customers request, Customer has the right to unilaterally select the Benchmarking Consultant from the pre-approved group.
(C)Provider will cooperate fully with the Benchmarking Consultant and provide all information relating to the provision of the Services to Customer that the Benchmarking Consultant requests. Benchmarking Consultant will compare the Fees against a Representative Sample of a sufficient number of Comparators, and will use normalization to ensure appropriate adjustments are made to all data to account for any differences between the Services and the Comparators so that a true like-for-like comparison is done.
(D)Only Customer may exercise the right to conduct a Benchmarking. Provider has no right to conduct a Benchmarking under this Section12.6 (Benchmarking Arrangement).
(E)To the extent that the Benchmarking reveals that the Fees under the applicable SOW for the Benchmarked Service are in the aggregate higher than the average of the Representative Sample (Benchmark Level) but are within [***] percent ([***]%) of the Benchmark Level (Accuracy Dead Band), then there will be no adjustment to such Fees. If the Benchmark determines that the Fees for the Benchmarked Services are in the aggregate higher than the Benchmark Level for such Benchmarked Services by more than the Accuracy Dead Band, then the applicable SOW will be amended to adjust the Fees for the Benchmarked Services in an amount equal to the percentage difference between the Fees for the Benchmarked Services and the Benchmark Level for such Benchmarked Services, less the applicable Dead Band, up to a maximum adjustment not to exceed [***] percent ([***]%) of the Fees that were in effect pursuant to the Fees Exhibit for such Services in such year (the Mandatory Adjustment). For example, if the Benchmark indicates that the Fees for the Benchmarked Services are [***] percent ([***]%) greater than the Benchmark Level, then the Mandatory Adjustment would be [***] percent ([***]%) (i.e., [***] percent ([***]%) minus the [***] percent ([***]%) dead band). Customer and Provider will negotiate any adjustment to the Fees in excess of the Mandatory Adjustment and escalate any dispute pursuant to Schedule 5 (Governance). If the Fees Exhibit of the applicable SOW is not amended within [***] days as set forth herein or Customer and Provider are unable to agree on any adjustment to the Fees above the Mandatory Adjustment after escalation pursuant to Schedule 5 (Governance), Customer will have the right to terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, for convenience in accordance with Section 19.1 (Termination for Convenience) but without payment of any applicable Termination Fees.
(F)Provider has no right to increase any Fees or decrease any Service Levels as a result of Benchmarking.
(G)Any Changes made to the charges pursuant to a Benchmark will take effect on a prospective basis [***] days following the Benchmarkers delivery of the final Benchmark Results.
(H)The Parties will resolve any disagreement related to the Benchmark using the dispute resolution process set forth in Schedule 5 (Governance).

ARTICLE 13.TAXES.
13.1Customer Tax Responsibility. Customer is liable for any sales tax, use tax, service tax, value added tax, transfer tax, excise tax, or any other similar tax imposed by any Governmental Authority arising from the performance or furnishing by Provider of Services or Providers Fees to Customer. Customer is not responsible for any tariffs, customs duties, and import fees based on Providers import or export of Provider Equipment, if any, as part of the Services, which will remain the responsibility of Provider. Such taxes will be invoiced by Provider to Customer unless Customer provides a valid resale certificate or other Documentation required under applicable Law to evidence tax exemption. Taxes must be invoiced on the same invoice as the product or Services that are subject to the tax. Provider invoices will separately state any Fees that are subject to taxation and separately identify the tax jurisdiction and the amount of taxes invoiced therein. Provider will assume any and all responsibility (including the payment of interest and penalty assessments levied by an applicable Governmental Authority) for failure to invoice, collect, or remit a tax.
13.2Provider Tax Responsibility. Provider is responsible for any sales tax, use tax, service tax, value added tax, transfer tax, excise tax, tariffs, duties, import fees, and any and all other similar tax imposed on Provider with respect to any labor, equipment, materials, goods, or services acquired, used, or consumed by Provider in providing the Services to Customer. Should Customer be required under applicable Law to withhold taxes on any payments to Provider or Provider Agents, Customer will be entitled to deduct any such withholdings from payments due to Provider.
13.3Excluded Tax Responsibilities. Neither Party is responsible for any franchise, privilege, income, gross receipts, or business activity taxes based on the other Partys gross or net income, net worth, or business activities. Neither Party is responsible for any real or personal property taxes assessed on tangible or intangible property owned or leased by the other Party.
13.4Tax Cooperation. Customer and Provider will cooperate to segregate the Fees into the following separate payment streams: (A)those for taxable Services; (B)those for nontaxable Services; (C)those for which a sales, use or other similar tax has already been paid; and (D)those for which Provider functions merely as a paying agent for Customer in receiving goods, supplies or services (including leasing and licensing arrangements) that otherwise are nontaxable or have previously been subject to tax. Provider will assist Customer to provide any Documentation necessary to prevent withholding, if applicable (see, e.g., Section13.2 (Provider Tax Responsibility)). In addition, each Party will cooperate as reasonably requested by the other Party to more accurately determine the requesting Partys tax liability and to minimize such liability, to the extent legally permissible. Each Party will provide and make available to the other Party any resale certificates, information regarding out-of-state sales or use of equipment, materials, or services, and any other exemption certificates or information requested by the other Party.
ARTICLE 14.AUDITS.
14.1Service Audits. Upon reasonable advance notice from Customer (which normally will be at least [***] Business Days, but may be less if Customer requires, in its sole discretion, that certain audits, such as physical security audits, be conducted upon shorter notice), Provider and Provider Agents will provide Customer, Customer Group, Customer Agents, and any and all regulators of Customer (Customer Auditors) with access to and any assistance that they may require with respect to the Service Locations and the Systems (other than access to a Shared Service Delivery Environment) for the purpose of performing audits or inspections of the Services and the business of Customer relating to the Services, including operational, security, safety, health, financial, social responsibility, and other audits, including but not limited to emergency response, disaster recovery, and business continuity. Pursuant to

written notice to Provider, Customer Auditors will be granted escorted access to Providers Shared Service Delivery Environments (other than a cloud services environment) for the purposes of addressing any significant security or service risks described in such notice. Provider will make every reasonable effort to comply with Customer request in a timely manner. If any audit by a Customer Auditor results in Provider being notified that Provider or Provider Agents are not in compliance with any Law or other requirement set forth in the Agreement, Provider will, and will cause Provider Agents to, promptly take actions to comply with such Law, or other requirement in the Agreement at no additional expense to Customer. Any third parties who perform audits under this Agreement will be Customer Agents which perform or render auditing services to or for Customer and are not an IBM Competitor and will execute an appropriate confidentiality agreement provided in advance in writing to Customer. Audits will be conducted during reasonable business hours and be conducted no more than twice annually and apply only to the previous twelve months activities (or, if longer, the time since the last previous audit) except in the case of audits required or performed by a Governmental Authority or security or emergency response, disaster recovery and business continuity audits, which may be conducted at any time on an ad-hoc basis.
14.2Fees Audits. Upon notice from Customer, Provider will provide Customer Auditors with access to such financial records and supporting Documentation as reasonably requested to determine if Fees and/or Termination Charge Amounts have been invoiced in accordance with the Agreement. Provider will promptly reimburse Customer for any overcharge revealed by such an audit. If the aggregate overcharges related to the period of such audit exceed US $[***], Provider will also reimburse Customer for the cost of such audit.
14.3Audits Required by Governmental Authorities. Upon the direction of a Governmental Authority having jurisdiction over Customer, and upon at least fifteen(15) days prior written notice from Customer, or upon such shorter period of time as may be required by the requesting Governmental Authority, Provider will provide the Governmental Authority and any other Customer Auditors, during normal business hours, with access to and any assistance (including reports) that they may require with respect to the records, systems, and operations of Provider relating to the Agreement.
14.4Providers Controls Audits. Provider will conduct its own audits pertaining to the Services consistent with the audit practices of well-managed companies that perform services similar to the Services. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Provider will provide to Customer for Provider and Provider Agents the following unqualified audits, in each case conducted by an independent public accounting firm, and certification:
(A)Annually on or before November 30, a Statement on Standards for Attestation Engagements No.16, Service Organization Control1, Type2 (SSAE16 SOCI Type2) audit as defined by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants) (SOC 1 Audit) provided that such SOC 1 Audit will be a multi-client audit covering the common processes designed and used by Provider for applicable Service Locations designated in the applicable Statement of Work.
