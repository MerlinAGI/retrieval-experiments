If the Benchmark determines that the Fees for the Benchmarked Services are in the aggregate higher than the Benchmark Level for such Benchmarked Services by more than the Accuracy Dead Band, then the applicable SOW will be amended to adjust the Fees for the Benchmarked Services in an amount equal to the percentage difference between the Fees for the Benchmarked Services and the Benchmark Level for such Benchmarked Services, less the applicable Dead Band, up to a maximum adjustment not to exceed [***] percent ([***]%) of the Fees that were in effect pursuant to the Fees Exhibit for such Services in such year (the Mandatory Adjustment). For example, if the Benchmark indicates that the Fees for the Benchmarked Services are [***] percent ([***]%) greater than the Benchmark Level, then the Mandatory Adjustment would be [***] percent ([***]%) (i.e., [***] percent ([***]%) minus the [***] percent ([***]%) dead band). Customer and Provider will negotiate any adjustment to the Fees in excess of the Mandatory Adjustment and escalate any dispute pursuant to Schedule 5 (Governance). If the Fees Exhibit of the applicable SOW is not amended within [***] days as set forth herein or Customer and Provider are unable to agree on any adjustment to the Fees above the Mandatory Adjustment after escalation pursuant to Schedule 5 (Governance), Customer will have the right to terminate the Agreement, in whole or in part, for convenience in accordance with Section 19.1 (Termination for Convenience) but without payment of any applicable Termination Fees.\n",
